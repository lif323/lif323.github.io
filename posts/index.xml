Current prevailing evalution methods mainly inlcudes two types: Feature Removal methods and Generation-based methods.
This paper hones in on the evaluation of the effectiveness of Post-hoc Explanation evaluation methods. Predominantly, current methodologies fall into two primary classifications: Feature Removal and Generation-based approaches.
Feature Removal operates on the principle of excising salient features identified through explanation mechanisms.</description></item></channel></rss>
